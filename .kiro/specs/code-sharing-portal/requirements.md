# Code Sharing Portal - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Code Sharing Portal feature will allow authenticated users to share their code snippets through secure, shareable links while maintaining the security of the main dashboard. Users can write code in an integrated IDE, generate shareable links, and allow others to view the code without requiring dashboard access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Editor Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write and edit code in an integrated IDE within the portal, so that I can create code snippets to share with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the code sharing section THEN the system SHALL display an integrated code editor (Monaco Editor or similar)
2. WHEN a user writes code THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages
3. WHEN a user selects a programming language THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate syntax highlighting and formatting
4. WHEN a user writes code THEN the system SHALL auto-save the code locally to prevent data loss
5. WHEN a user wants to save code THEN the system SHALL allow them to give it a title and description

### Requirement 2: Secure Code Sharing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate shareable links for my code snippets, so that I can share my code with others without giving them access to my dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Share Code" THEN the system SHALL generate a unique, secure shareable link
2. WHEN a shareable link is generated THEN the system SHALL create a public UUID-based identifier that doesn't expose user information
3. WHEN a shareable link is created THEN the system SHALL store the code snippet with metadata (title, description, language, creation date)
4. WHEN a user generates a link THEN the system SHALL provide options for link expiration (24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, never)
5. WHEN a user generates a link THEN the system SHALL allow them to set the code as public or unlisted
6. WHEN a user wants to manage shared codes THEN the system SHALL display a list of all their shared code snippets with analytics

### Requirement 3: Public Code Viewing

**User Story:** As anyone with a shared link, I want to view the shared code snippet in a clean, readable format, so that I can understand and potentially use the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN someone accesses a valid shared link THEN the system SHALL display the code in a clean, public viewer interface
2. WHEN viewing shared code THEN the system SHALL NOT require authentication or dashboard access
3. WHEN viewing shared code THEN the system SHALL display syntax highlighting appropriate to the programming language
4. WHEN viewing shared code THEN the system SHALL show the code title, description, programming language, and creation date
5. WHEN viewing shared code THEN the system SHALL provide a "Copy Code" button for easy copying
6. WHEN viewing shared code THEN the system SHALL show view count and last viewed timestamp
7. WHEN accessing an expired or invalid link THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4: Code Management Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage all my shared code snippets from a central dashboard, so that I can track, edit, and control access to my shared codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the code management section THEN the system SHALL display all their shared code snippets
2. WHEN viewing shared codes THEN the system SHALL show title, creation date, view count, expiration status, and share link
3. WHEN a user wants to edit a shared code THEN the system SHALL allow them to update the code, title, and description
4. WHEN a user wants to delete a shared code THEN the system SHALL remove the code and invalidate the share link
5. WHEN a user wants to extend expiration THEN the system SHALL allow them to modify the expiration date
6. WHEN a user views analytics THEN the system SHALL show view statistics, geographic data (if available), and access timestamps

### Requirement 5: Security and Privacy Controls

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control who can access my shared code and ensure my dashboard remains secure, so that I can share code safely without compromising my account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating share links THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random UUIDs
2. WHEN someone accesses a shared link THEN the system SHALL NOT expose any user account information
3. WHEN sharing code THEN the system SHALL allow users to set password protection for sensitive code
4. WHEN accessing password-protected code THEN the system SHALL require the correct password before displaying content
5. WHEN a shared link is accessed THEN the system SHALL log access attempts for security monitoring
6. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL allow users to immediately revoke all shared links
7. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL automatically remove all their shared code snippets

### Requirement 6: Code Collaboration Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enable collaboration features on my shared code, so that others can provide feedback and suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sharing code THEN the system SHALL allow users to enable/disable comments on shared code
2. WHEN comments are enabled THEN visitors SHALL be able to leave feedback with a name and email
3. WHEN comments are submitted THEN the system SHALL notify the code owner via email
4. WHEN viewing shared code with comments THEN the system SHALL display all approved comments
5. WHEN managing shared code THEN the system SHALL allow owners to moderate and approve/reject comments
6. WHEN sharing code THEN the system SHALL provide an option to allow code forking/copying with attribution

### Requirement 7: Code Categories and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize my shared code snippets into categories and add tags, so that I can better manage and others can easily find relevant code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating shared code THEN the system SHALL allow users to select from predefined categories (Web Development, Mobile, Data Science, etc.)
2. WHEN creating shared code THEN the system SHALL allow users to add custom tags
3. WHEN viewing the code management dashboard THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by category, tags, and date
4. WHEN accessing public shared code THEN the system SHALL display category and tags for better context
5. WHEN browsing shared codes THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality based on title, description, and tags

### Requirement 8: Integration with Learning Platform

**User Story:** As a student using the learning platform, I want to easily share code from my assignments and projects, so that I can get help from instructors and peers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working on assignments THEN the system SHALL provide a "Share for Help" button that creates temporary, instructor-accessible links
2. WHEN sharing assignment code THEN the system SHALL automatically tag it with the course and assignment information
3. WHEN instructors access shared assignment code THEN the system SHALL provide tools for adding feedback and suggestions
4. WHEN sharing code for peer review THEN the system SHALL create time-limited links that expire after the review period
5. WHEN students share code THEN the system SHALL maintain academic integrity by tracking and logging all shares

## Technical Considerations

- Use Monaco Editor for the code editing experience
- Implement UUID v4 for secure link generation
- Use Redis or similar for caching frequently accessed shared codes
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use CDN for fast global access to shared code snippets
- Implement proper SEO for public shared codes (when appropriate)
- Ensure mobile-responsive design for code viewing
- Implement syntax highlighting for 20+ popular programming languages

## Security Considerations

- All shared links must be cryptographically secure
- No user information should be exposed in public views
- Implement proper input sanitization for code content
- Use HTTPS for all shared link access
- Implement CSRF protection for authenticated actions
- Regular security audits of shared code access patterns
- Implement automatic link expiration cleanup
