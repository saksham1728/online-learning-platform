# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing and enhancing the job scraping functionality in the educational platform. The current system has multiple confusing options (Fresh Scrape, Test Scrape, Refresh Jobs), broken apply links, and needs improved scraping logic to filter and present the best job opportunities from LinkedIn, Internshala, and other job portals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Simplify Job Scraping Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single, clear option to refresh job recommendations, so that I can easily get updated job listings without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the job recommendations page loads THEN the system SHALL show only one "Refresh Jobs" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Refresh Jobs" THEN the system SHALL scrape fresh jobs from all configured portals
3. WHEN the scraping is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a clear loading state with progress information
4. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL display the updated job listings with match scores
5. WHEN scraping fails THEN the system SHALL show cached jobs with appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 2: Fix Apply Links Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to apply to jobs directly by clicking the apply button, so that I can seamlessly transition from job discovery to application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job listing is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a working "Apply Now" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Apply Now" THEN the system SHALL open the original job posting URL in a new tab
3. WHEN the job URL is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate message and disable the button
4. WHEN the apply link is clicked THEN the system SHALL track the application attempt for analytics
5. WHEN multiple apply options exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most direct application method

### Requirement 3: Enhance Scraping Logic for Better Job Quality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see high-quality, relevant job recommendations that match my skills and experience level, so that I can focus on the best opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping jobs THEN the system SHALL filter out duplicate postings across portals
2. WHEN processing job listings THEN the system SHALL prioritize jobs with complete information (salary, requirements, description)
3. WHEN ranking jobs THEN the system SHALL use enhanced matching algorithm based on skills, experience, and location preferences
4. WHEN displaying jobs THEN the system SHALL show only jobs with match scores above 60%
5. WHEN no high-quality matches exist THEN the system SHALL expand search criteria and inform the user

### Requirement 4: Improve Scraping Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want job scraping to be fast and reliable, so that I can get fresh job recommendations without long wait times or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping multiple portals THEN the system SHALL run scraping operations in parallel
2. WHEN a portal fails to respond THEN the system SHALL continue with other portals and show partial results
3. WHEN scraping takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress updates and estimated completion time
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent backoff and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL cache results for improved subsequent load times

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Job Matching Algorithm

**User Story:** As a user, I want job recommendations that accurately reflect my qualifications and career goals, so that I can find the most suitable opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating match scores THEN the system SHALL consider skill relevance, experience level, location preference, and salary expectations
2. WHEN a user has limited experience THEN the system SHALL prioritize internships and entry-level positions
3. WHEN a user has specific skills THEN the system SHALL boost jobs requiring those skills in the ranking
4. WHEN location preferences are set THEN the system SHALL prioritize remote jobs and local opportunities
5. WHEN salary information is available THEN the system SHALL factor compensation alignment into match scoring

### Requirement 6: Real-time Scraping Status and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates during job scraping, so that I understand what's happening and how long it will take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping starts THEN the system SHALL show a detailed progress indicator with current portal being scraped
2. WHEN each portal completes THEN the system SHALL update progress with job counts found
3. WHEN processing and ranking jobs THEN the system SHALL show "Analyzing matches..." status
4. WHEN scraping encounters errors THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages with retry options
5. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL show a summary of jobs found from each portal

### Requirement 7: Smart Caching and Data Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want fresh job data when needed but also fast loading when recent data is available, so that I have an optimal experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jobs were scraped within the last 2 hours THEN the system SHALL use cached data by default
2. WHEN a user explicitly requests fresh data THEN the system SHALL scrape new jobs regardless of cache age
3. WHEN cached data is used THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the data age to the user
4. WHEN new jobs are scraped THEN the system SHALL merge with existing data and remove outdated listings
5. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old job data

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Portal Coverage and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to jobs from multiple reliable sources, so that I don't miss opportunities available on different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping LinkedIn THEN the system SHALL handle anti-bot measures and rate limiting gracefully
2. WHEN scraping Internshala THEN the system SHALL extract both internships and full-time positions
3. WHEN scraping Indeed THEN the system SHALL parse job details including salary and requirements

4. WHEN job details are incomplete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate missing information
5. WHEN users interact with jobs THEN the system SHALL provide quick actions (save, share, apply)

### Requirement 10: Analytics and Insights

**User Story:** As a user, I want insights into my job search performance and market trends, so that I can improve my job search strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jobs are displayed THEN the system SHALL track which jobs users view and apply to
2. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL show market insights (average salaries, trending skills)
3. WHEN users apply to jobs THEN the system SHALL track application success rates and provide feedback
4. WHEN job search patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL suggest profile improvements
5. WHEN market data is available THEN the system SHALL show salary benchmarks and skill demand trends
